# Pathfinding
This repository is a personal project of mine.

I aim to implement a flexible framework for evaluating and benchmarking several pathfinding algorithms.

## Speed of development
Slowly, but continuously. Very minor changes will come in on a daily to weekly basis. If I have time on my hand, I will work on bigger changes with more depth.

## Goals of this project
- Capable framework to test pre-defined (and custom) algorithms in pre-defined (and custom) environments
- Benchmarking to visualize and quantify the quality and versatility of the algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning approach if the framework is in a stable state

In the end, this repository might even be helpful for those working on games, (mods), robotics or on something similar. My main objective is personal though:

## Personal goals
- Continuous work; even in the smallest steps
- Structuring a long time programming project
- Visualizing and documenting certain development and project states
- Leveraging and learning about advanced Git(Hub) features

I will state clearly if I entirely stop working on this repository.
