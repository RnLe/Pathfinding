# Pathfinding
This repository is a personal project of mine.

The goal is to implement a flexible framework for evaluating and benchmarking several pathfinding algorithms.

## Speed of development
Slowly. If I have time on my hand, I will work on bigger changes with more depth.

## Goals of this project
- Capable framework to test pre-defined (and custom) algorithms in pre-defined (and custom) environments
- Benchmarking to visualize and quantify the quality and versatility of the algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning approach if the framework is in a stable state

I will state clearly if I entirely stop working on this repository.
