# Pathfinding
This repository is a personal project of mine.

I aim to implement a capable framework to handle diverse environments to test and benchmark several pathfinding algorithms.

## Speed of development
Slowly, but continuously. Very minor changes will come in on a daily to weekly basis. If I have time on my hand, I will chunk in bigger portions of changes which also have more depth.

## Goals of this project
- Capable framework to test pre-defined (and customized) algorithms in pre-defined (and custom) environments
- Benchmarking to visualize and quantize the quality and versatility of the algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning approach if the framework is in a stable state

## Personal goals
- Continuous work; even just in small steps
- Structuring a long time programming project
- Visualizing certain development and project states
- Leveraging and learning about advanced Git(Hub) features
